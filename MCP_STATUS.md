# ChronoTask MCP Server Status

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING

The ChronoTask MCP server is fully functional and accessible at:
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mcp`
- **Transport**: SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- **Protocol Version**: 2024-11-05

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the server is working:
```bash
./test_mcp_claude.sh
```

## Known Issue

`claude mcp list` may show "Failed to connect" due to a known issue with Claude Code's health check for SSE servers. This is a Claude Code client issue, not a server problem.

The server is still fully functional despite this status message.

## Verified Functionality

✅ Protocol version: 2024-11-05
✅ Initialize with session management
✅ List tools (supports both `list_tools` and `tools/list`)
✅ Call tools (supports both `call_tool` and `tools/call`)
✅ SSE streaming for real-time updates
✅ HTTP POST for JSON-RPC requests
✅ CORS support

## MCP Configuration

The server is configured in Claude Code as:
```json
{
  "chronotask": {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mcp/sse"
  }
}
```
